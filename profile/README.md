# Hello, this is Metacity 👋 

Metacity is a set of tools for urban data synthesis, analysis & visualization. Our goal is to create a new generation of open-source tools and services targeted at developers, urban planners and the general public. We believe that urban data visualization should make the city look like a city, not a giant spreadsheet. 

By combining **open data, simulation models and design thinking**, we want to provide:
- a simple tool for general public to help them make better decisions about their own lives
- an intuitive set of tools and services for decision-makers to help them make better decisions about urban development
- a set of services for developers and architects to help them make better decisions about their own projects
